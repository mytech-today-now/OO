Generate an Augment AI prompt for PowerShell that will scan the computer for "O & O Shutup" Application.  If it isn't found, it will download and install it.  After silently installing it, the "O & O Shutup will be run in silent mode, so that "default" recommended settings are set, a restore point is created, and the application is closed with a notice to restart the computer to activate the settings.  What we are trying to achieve is the installation and activation of "O & O Shutup" without actually interacting with the program itself, but running it through cmd line arguemnts to get the protection from Microsoft Spyware and stop the telemetry to Microsoft that "O & O Shutup" provides by default.  

Using the rules and guidelines of '.augment/' files, generate this prompt.
